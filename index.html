<TD colspan=5><CENTER> <FONT COLOR=yellow> <FONT SIZE=5> <P> HISTORY: 
<TD colspan=5><CENTER> <FONT COLOR=white> <FONT SIZE=5> Don Macchiatos was founded in Cebu, Philippines, in October 2022 by Nickie San Juan, a former call center agent who experienced financial difficulty affording coffee as a student, aiming to provide affordable and quality coffee (around 39 pesos). They grew from a local phenomenon to a widely recognized brand by focusing on accessibility and community, becoming known as Cebu's first P39 coffee. The brand officially started in October 2022, building on success from their prior venture, Pure Leaf Milktea. Their affordable, viral success quickly spread across Cebu and other Philippine cities, inspiring many other budget coffee vendors. </CENTER> </P>

They faced challenges but remained dedicated to their dream, inspired by college struggles to offer quality drinks for everyone, growing from a small stall to a national brand supported by endorsements (like Daniel Padilla) and a focus on local support, especially for farmers and aspiring entrepreneurs. They started with a small corner stall in Cebu. In essence, their story is about turning financial hardship and a love for coffee into a successful, inclusive brand that champions local support and accessibility for all. </CENTER> </P>

<TD colspan=5><CENTER> <FONT COLOR=yellow> <FONT SIZE=5> <P> CHALLENGE MET BY THE OWNER:
<TD colspan=5><CENTER> <FONT COLOR=white> <FONT SIZE=5> A primary challenge was finding high-quality ingredients that would allow them to sell coffee at the low price point of P39 and only a few loyal customers. They had to find their place in an already competitive coffee market, especially with the rise of other businesses inspired by their affordable coffee concept. As the business rapidly expanded, they occasionally ran out of stock, leading to potential delays in delivery from their main base in Cebu. Nickie San Juan was personally motivated to start the business due to her own financial constraints as a student, highlighting the initial difficulty in funding and managing a new venture. They had to deal diverse customer opinions, including some negative feedback regarding quality or false advertising, addressing these issues while maintaining their brand reputation. </CENTER> </P>

<TD colspan=5><CENTER> <FONT COLOR=yellow> <FONT SIZE=5> <P> How did the Philippine government help the business grow?
<TD colspan=5><CENTER> <FONT COLOR=white> <FONT SIZE=5> The Philippine government helps businesses grow through offering tax incentives, investing heavily in infrastructure, providing financial aid (loans), and fostering public-private partnerships to create a favorable, competitive environment for both local and foreign investment, boosting jobs and economic activity. These measures aim to attract investment, empower small businesses, and generate quality jobs for inclusive economic growth. </CENTER> </P
